    <h1>My Hobby</h1>
      <p>My favorite hobby is playing video games. I've been playing games since I was 3 years old, with the Nintendo Gamecube. I have played many types of game, like action, RPGs, puzzles, ect. But I want to go over the best of the best of Video Games.</p>
    <h2>My favorite franchises</h2>
      <p>I would like to go over some of the best franchises I have ever played, because many of the games I like are from the same franchise.<br> Doom is one of the best shooters out there, with the exploration & combat.<br> Final Fantasy is the prime example of what great RPGs should be.<br> And Portal & Portal 2 are the best games I have ever played, even though I don't care for puzzle games.</p>
