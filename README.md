          <article><h2>My favorite franchises</h2>
            <p>I would like to go over some of the best franchises I have ever played, because many of the games I like are from the same franchise. <br>Doom is one of the best shooters out there, with the exploration & combat. <br>Final Fantasy is the prime example of what great RPGs should be. <br>And Portal & Portal 2 are the best games I have ever played, even though I don't care for puzzle games.</p></article>
